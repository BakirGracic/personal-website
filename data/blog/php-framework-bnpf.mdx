summary: My take on building the best PHP backend framework
---

The Boring Name PHP Framework (BNPF) is a procedural, non-OOP PHP framework designed for building RESTful backend APIs. It emphasizes a simple code structure that's easy to understand and customize, focusing on per-concern files and code organization. The framework includes a range of features, such as API versioning, support for MySQL and Redis, JWT authentication, and advanced logging and error handling mechanisms. It's geared towards developers seeking a lightweight, efficient solution for backend development with a focus on learning and customization.
